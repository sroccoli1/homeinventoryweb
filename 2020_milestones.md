# Home Inventory Web - 2020 Milestones

**Some of my Web Dev journey, shortly**

### Feb
- Started using Git and GitHub!
- Pushed Home inventory on Github (created repository). 

### March
Started learning ReactJS [(following this tutorial)](https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html). And stopped not long after! This approach felt very difficult.

### April
- Github's Home Inventory Web repository becomes public.
- The cardboard search bar searches throught the database. Coded my own AJAX Http request and PDO query against the MySQL JSON Database!

### Sept - Dec
- Learning Angular via [(this course)](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-guide-to-angular-2/) and looking forward to using in the next developments! 

### Some Thoughts
- Using Git & Github was very difficult at the beginning, then finally very rewarding at the end.
- Managed to fetch data from the web server and database, with my own AJAX code! It does look uglyâ€¦ I would probably have a cleaner code to fetch web server data with a framework (for instance RubyOnRails...)<br>
- CSS on its own can be fun, but stylesheets are getting larger, more complex, and harder to maintain. This is where a preprocessor can help. Sass for instance?
