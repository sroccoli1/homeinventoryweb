Filling the cardboard boxes with the families items they wanted to take, and checking during calls what was where,... 
<br>My kids and my wife departed few months before me. 
<br>I was left alone to do the job efficiently!

### Day 1: I wrote the first version of Home Inventory  
(Writing retrospectively) I believe the first day was the 5 Dec 2018 when I wrote the version of the concept of Home Inventory.
I was finishing the race to the move to Finland, that occured 15 days ahead.

### Day 18-19 Dec 2018 : Days of the move with a international moving company !
From [Trappes (France)](https://www.instagram.com/trappesofficiel/) to [Oulu (Finland)](https://visitoulu.fi/). No incident. Phew!
