Filling the cardboard boxes with the families items they wanted to take, and checking during calls what was where,... 
My kids and my wife departed few months before me. 
I was left alone to do the job efficiently!

I was finishing the race to the move to Finland, that occured 15 days ahead.

### Day 18-19 Dec 2018 : Days of the move with a international moving company !
From Trappes (France) to Oulu (Finland). No incident. Phew!
