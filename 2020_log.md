# Home Inventory Web - 2020 Log

**My Web Dev journey log**

### Week April 27

#### I don't have time to read: what should I remember?

- Troubles with DB connection after migrating from Lubuntu 16 to Win 10
- Can't save a new cardboard!

(Pictures to come)

#### Full story

My Lubuntu installation for web development crashed and the OS should be reinstalled totally!<br>
On a second partition, I had installed Win 10 OS. I recreated my web dev environment, based on: <br>
- WAMPServer
- Notepad++
- Git<br> 

and pulled the HIW repository.
<br> As right there's no  installation and configuration process for Win 10 environment, it was really a good time to practice and write it. 

<br> I was expecting to start coding exactly where I left previously. But unfortunately, there was a problem of database connection, exactly where it was fine on Lubuntu.
<br>**Can't save a new cardboard! :-(**
  
    SQLSTATE\[HY100]\[1045] Access denied for user 'homeinventorydev'@'localhost' (using password: YES)<br>
    code: 1045
  
The bug investigation and fixing lasted the whole week. Felt so uncompetent.
- Dived again in MySQL documentation
- Looked through similar issues on Stackoverflow
- Looked for MySQL v8.0 version changes
- Looked for Wampserver PDO plugin
- Looked for MySQL config file
- Changed the connection parameters, user login, user privileges multiple times 

<br> Finally I got it fixed! When I precised the port value used in the `$servername` param:

    $servername = "localhost:3308";

<br> After struggling so much: 
- I wrote couple of PHP PDO scripts that speed up DB, user, and tables creation/destruction => Ready to the next DB admin session!
- Specified GUI views for DB admin in user session for DB, user, and tables creation and destruction. Who long will it takes to implement this?
