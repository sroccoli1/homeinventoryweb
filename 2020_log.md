## Week 17 (April, 27th)

**Weekâ€™s Progress:** 
  - Fixed a DB connection issue after migrating from Lubuntu 16 to Win 10. Figured out that a DB connection parameters was wrong.

       
              $servername = "localhost:3308"; //Correct port used by MySQL on Win 10
  - Wrote a script in case of future DB issues investigations.
  - Figured out a DB Admin Use Case.

**Thoughts:** It was a tough week of investigation, I felt very uncapable, but diving into MySQL, PHP and Wampserver documentation with a bug perspective made me learn more than ever about these systems.

## Week 18 (2020, May 9th) 

**Week's progress:** 
- I drawed how the Cardboard Search searches for cardboards and displays cardboard info, focusing on it's AJAX architecture.

- Started to restructure and clean HTML and CSS code of the Search Cardboard page, before starting to code the Cardboard Object View.

**Thoughts:** Modelling helped me to have an overview on what I coded, and see where I could implement the Cardboard Object View (of the Cardboard Search page).

## Week 19 - 2020.5.12 

**Week's progress:** 
- On the cardboard search page I continued the styling: now by pressing the cardboard you can toggle the cardboard details view. Exiting!

- On the same page I started restructuring the PHP code sending the DB results to the client, and so the JS, so that it would process it into a table.

  - Currently : the server formats part of the DB data into a table and send it to the browser. So the browser don't have to much formatting task. But as a result, it need another AJAX request and other code structure.  

  - Wish : It would be easier that the server just send all the needed cardboard info, plain, to the browser, which would format it.
  
  - Goal : Change the PHP code so that it send the needed JSON data to the client, which just need to format it.

**Thoughts:** This involved lots of analysing, problem solving, decision skills and patience! As I'm not yet familiar with JSON processing with JS, I need to check many time the structure as it changes, depending on if it is a library function result or my own functions results: string, table, table of string, table of objects with tables in it... Finding my way using the browser dev tools and those websites: [developer.mozilla.org](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference) and [W3Schools.com](https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/default.asp)!

## Week  20 - 2020.5.16

**Week's progress:** 
- I have successfully reorganised the Search Cardboard page's back-end and JS code, I had started restructuring last week. Now PHP sends only raw JSON fetched from the database to the browser, then JS formats the data into a table. 
- Now making the page responsive. The object overview table is already responsive, made with JS and CSS.<br>

Here is what the design file tells about the page's responsiveness:<br>

- Sent my application for the H2C program. [H2C.fi](https://h2c.fi/)

**Thoughts:** I feel better now that I have gotten how to deal with JSON with JS, it was the first time! And it's now over, page styling is easier.

## Week 21 - 2020.5.24 

**Week's progress:**
- Found Web dev vocab in Finnish and written down the week log in Finnish
- Updated the source code organisation 
- Found a better log structure and updated it
- On the Cardboard Search page, progressed on the styling of the Cardboard object view, changed fonts and div paddings.

**Thoughts:** About CMD.<br>
To update the source code organisation I had imagined myself using only Git commands. It took me a while to get that it was a waste of time, and eventually to admit that I didn't even know the CMD commands to move files to the upper folder.<br> `cp foldername .`<br>
It reminds me of this saying, brought up within the #DEV or #CodeNewbie community:

> A bad developer says that she/he knows, but a good developer says that she/he knows nothing.

Continuous learning.
