# Home Inventory Web - 2020 Log

**My Web Dev journey weekly log**

### Week April 27
My Lubuntu installation for web development crashed and the OS should be reinstalled totally!<br>
On a second partition, I had installed Win 10 OS. I recreated my web dev environment: <br>
- WAMPServer
- Notepad++
- Git
And pulled the HIW repository.
It is really a good time to write the HIW installation configutation process for Win 10 workstation, and perhaps make it smoother.

Noticed that the current script to setup a database...
Had to read again MySQL documentation...
(TBD)
