## Week 17 (April, 27th)

**Weekâ€™s Progress:** 
  - Fixed a DB connection issue after migrating from Lubuntu 16 to Win 10. Figured out that a DB connection parameters was wrong.

       
              $servername = "localhost:3308"; //Correct port used by MySQL on Win 10
  - Wrote a script in case of future DB issues investigations.
  - Figured out a DB Admin Use Case.

**Thoughts:** It was a tough week of investigation, I felt very uncapable, but diving into MySQL, PHP and Wampserver documentation with a bug perspective made me learn more than ever about these systems.

## Week 18 (2020, May 9th) 

**Week's progress:** 
- I drawed how the Cardboard Search searches for cardboards and displays cardboard info, focusing on it's AJAX architecture.

- Started to restructure and clean HTML and CSS code of the Search Cardboard page, before starting to code the Cardboard Object View.

**Thoughts:** Modelling helped me to have an overview on what I coded, and see where I could implement the Cardboard Object View (of the Cardboard Search page).

## Week 19 - 2020.5.12 

**Week's progress:** 
- On the cardboard search page I continued the styling: now by pressing the cardboard you can toggle the cardboard details view. Exiting!

- On the same page I started restructuring the PHP code sending the DB results to the client, and so the JS, so that it would process it into a table.

  - Currently : the server formats part of the DB data into a table and send it to the browser. So the browser don't have to much formatting task. But as a result, it need another AJAX request and other code structure.  

  - Wish : It would be easier that the server just send all the needed cardboard info, plain, to the browser, which would format it.
  
  - Goal : Change the PHP code so that it send the needed JSON data to the client, which just need to format it.

**Thoughts:** This involved lots of analysing, problem solving, decision skills and patience! As I'm not yet familiar with JSON processing with JS, I need to check many time the structure as it changes, depending on if it is a library function result or my own functions results: string, table, table of string, table of objects with tables in it... Finding my way using the browser dev tools and those websites: [developer.mozilla.org](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference) and [W3Schools.com](https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/default.asp)!
