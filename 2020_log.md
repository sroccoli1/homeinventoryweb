## Week 17 (April, 27th)

**Week’s Progress:** 
  - Fixed a DB connection issue after migrating from Lubuntu 16 to Win 10. Figured out that a DB connection parameters was wrong.

       
              $servername = "localhost:3308"; //Correct port used by MySQL on Win 10
  - Wrote a script in case of future DB issues investigations.
  - Figured out a DB Admin Use Case. 

**Thoughts:** It was a tough week of investigation, I felt very uncapable, but diving into MySQL, PHP and Wampserver documentation with a bug perspective made me learn more than ever about these systems.
