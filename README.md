3 main usage : 
Inventory at the moving departure place 
Checker at the destination place
Where is what ? (in which cardboard is what?)
Notify when goal is weight<limit is soon reached.
I have noticed the movables weight is over the limit... I can save this configuration for later, unselect items and set a new configurationâ€¦ and save them for later (without deleting).
Tired of entering data with the GUI? You can instead edit the inventory in XLS then upload it and use the services.
