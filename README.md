## Problems when preparing your next move

From experience, moving is often a painstaking, slow but necessary process. Fortunately when one can get help from family or friends or from a moving company, travelling becomes easier. But there is always hassle when it comes to packing, inventoring, unboxing and looking for one's stuff. Here is a list of some of the problems that we may encounter:
1. The moving date is much too close, not leaving time to organise, and ending with sleep debt. So we end up forgetting what is in which cardboard. After the move, searching for stuff become a time consuming challenge. (Time constraint.)
2. The international moving company must respect a truck load limit when it reaches a country border, crossing on a ferry. When it is over the limit, the moving cost shifts to the upper truck price category. So you must know the global weight a of your move, thus the load of each cardboard or items. (Weight constraint.)
3. The volume of your move must fit in the truck. (Volume constraint.)
4. The moving company has requested you for a full inventory of your stuff so that :
  - before the moving you and the company know the value of your stuff, which can be used with insurance in case of loss ;
  - at the destination you can check out all your stuff. 

### homeinventoryweb solution

3 main usages : 
- Inventory at the moving departure place (Answer to : where is what ? In which cardboard is what?) 
- Inventory checker at the destination place
- Weight limit and overall value dashboard
