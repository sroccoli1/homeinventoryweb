#### Problems when preparing your next move

The moving date is much too close, not leaving time to organise, and with sleep debt. So we end up forgetting what is in which cardboard. After the move, searching for staff become a time consuming challenge. (Time constraint.)

The international moving company must respect a truck load limit when it reaches a country border, crossing on a ferry. When it is over the limit, the moving cost shifts to the upper truck price category. So you must know the global weight a of your move, thus the load of each cardboard or items. (Weight constrainst.)

The volume of your move must fit in the truck. (Volume constrainst.)

The moving company has requested you for a full inventory of your staff so that :
- before the moving value you and the company know the value of your staff, which can be used with insurance in case of loss ;
- at destination you can check out all your staff

I have noticed the movables weight is over the limit... I can save this configuration for later, unselect items and set a new configurationâ€¦ and save them for later (without deleting).
