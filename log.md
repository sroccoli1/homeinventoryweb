# Home Inventory Web - Milestones and Log

## 2018 Milestones

### Day 0
(Writing retrospectively) I was really struggling at cleaning, at filling the cardboard boxes, weighing them, sizing them, and emptying the 4 rooms flat and selling items...
Filling the cardboard boxes with the families items they wanted to take, and checking during calls what was where,... 
My kids and my wife departed few months before me. 
I was left alone to do the job efficiently!

### Day 1: I wrote the first version of Home Inventory  
(Writing retrospectively) I believe the first day was the 5 Dec 2018 when I wrote the version of the concept of Home Inventory.
