# Home Inventory Web - Milestones and Log

## Milestones

### Day 0
(Writing retrospectively) I was really struggling at cleaning, at filling the cardbord boxes with the families items they wanted to take, and emptying the 4 rooms flat and selling items... 
My kids and my wife departed few months before me. 
I was left alone to do the job efficiently!

### Day 1: 5 Dec 2018
(Writing retrospectively) I believe the first day was the 5 Dec 2018 when I wrote the version of the concept of Home Inventory.
I was in the last run of my move to Finland, that occured 15 days ahead.

### Day 18-19 Dec 2018 : Days of the move with a international moving company !
From Trappes (France) to Oulu (Finland). No incident. Phew!

### Day I got started with web programming. 
Christmas 2018. Thank you Eli The Computer Guy for [this superbe tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=27dR_sLaM74&list=PL6C3CB409A8577C2F)! You help me a lot!
